        <h1>TREŚĆ UTWORU</h1>
        <p>If you take a step towards me</p>
        You will take my breath away</p>
        So I'll keep you close</p>
        And keep my secret safe</p>
        <br>
        No one else has ever loved me</p>
        No one else has ever tried</p>
        I never understood</p>
        How much I could take</p>
        <br>
        Then I saw the worst was over</p>
        When I laid my eyes on you</p>
        It was all that I could do to know my place</p>
        <br>
        Out of all the vast illusions</p>
        Out of all the dreams come true</p>
        I was gone until</p>
        I finally saw your face</p>
        <br>
        If you cried out for more</p>
        If you reached out for me</p>
        I would run into the storm</p>
        Just to keep you here with me</p>
        <br>
        I have gone beyond my years</p>
        I've wasted half my life</p>
        But I found it all in you</p>
        Did I save you?</p>
        'Cause I know you saved me too</p>
        <br>
        Let me take a step towards you</p>
        Let me feel you in my hands</p>
        Let me cross this line</p>
        And show you where it leads</p>
        <br>
        There's a darkness down inside me</p>
        That I know we'll both enjoy</p>
        And it's screaming from within</p>
        To set it free</p>
        <br>
        I have left this bloody nightmare</p>
        In my wake, bored out of time</p>
        And I won this deviation by design</p>
        <br>
        Out of all the past confusion</p>
        Out of all the common spite</p>
        Just tell me I am yours</p>
        'Cause you are mine</p>

        And if you cried out for more</p>
        If you reached out for me</p>
        I would run into the storm</p>
        Just to keep you here with me</p>
        <br>
        I have gone beyond my years</p>
        I've wasted half my life</p>
        But I found it all in you</p>
        Did I save you?</p>
        'Cause I know you saved me too</p>
        <br>
        It doesn't really matter what you do or say</p>
        I'm never going anywhere anyway</p>
        'Cause when I'm dying for you</p>
        I've never felt so alive</p>
        <br>
        If you cried out for more</p>
        If you reached out for me</p>
        I would run into the storm</p>
        Just to keep you here with me</p>
        <br>
        I have gone beyond my years</p>
        I've wasted half my life</p>
        But I found it all in you</p>
        Did I save you?</p>
        'Cause I know you saved me too</p>
        <br>
        I know you saved me too</p><br><br>
